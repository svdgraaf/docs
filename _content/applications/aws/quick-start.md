# Quick Start

This guide will walk you through setting up the AWS IoT integration using CloudFormation: an easy process to configure one of the most advanced integrations for The Things Network.

1. Log in to the [AWS Management Console](http://console.aws.amazon.com)
2. Click on [this link](https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=eu-west-1#/stacks/create/review?filter=active&templateURL=https:%2F%2Fs3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fsvdgraaf-bitlog%2Fcloudformation.template&stackName=TTN-AWS-Integration&param_AccountServer=https:%2F%2Faccount.thethingsnetwork.org&param_DiscoveryServer=discovery.thethings.network:1900&param_InstanceType=t2.micro&param_ThingShadowDeltaFPort=1&param_ThingSyncEnabled=true&param_ThingSyncInterval=10m&param_ThingTypeName=lorawan) to create a new stack

   * Enter a **Stack name**, for example `ttn-app`
   * Enter the **AppID** and an **AppAccessKey** of your application in The Things Network
   * Enter an **EnvironmentName** for Elastic Beanstalk, for example `ttn-app`
   * If you are using a private network, change the **AccountServer** and **DiscoveryServer** to the endpoints of your private network
   * Select an existing EC2 KeyPair in **KeyName** to access the EC2 instance. [Read more](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html)

   > The **AppAccessKey** that you enter should at least have the `messages` and `devices` rights.

   Example parameters:

3. Review your settings and check the **I acknowledge** box to acknowledge that resources for the integration may be created in your AWS account
4. Click **Create** to initiate the creation of the stack
5. After a coffee break of about six minutes, you will see two new stacks:

    > The `awseb-...` stack is an AWS Elastic Beanstalk stack that is created as part of the stack of the integration process.

ðŸŽ‰ You have now successfully configured the AWS IoT integration! See the guides on the left to learn working with the [thing registry](./thing-registry.md), [test messages](./test-messages.md), [thing shadows](./thing-shadows.md), [act on data](./act-on-data.md), [view metrics](./view-metrics.md) and [update](./update.md) the integration.
